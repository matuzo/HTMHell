## Issues and how to fix them

1. The `type` attribute has no effect on the semantics of an `<a>` element.
1. An anchor may have the `type` attribute, but the value should be a valid [MIME type](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Basics_of_HTTP/MIME_types/Complete_list_of_MIME_types). Browsers may consider it, but it's purely advisory.
1. If the presence of the `href` attribute makes sense, you most definitely want to use a proper link (`<a>`) and not a button, no matter how the element looks like in your design.
1. {{ snippets.negative_tabindex }}.
1. {{ snippets.native_semantics }}
1. {{ snippets.use_button }}
1. When Gzip compression is enabled on the web server, having `href` as the first attribute improves performance.
