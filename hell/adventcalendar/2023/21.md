<!-- Eric: My comments echo Manuel's. Beyond that, this is a great piece about a par of HTML I wish more people knew about. Thank you for writing it. -->

Consider a scenario where you have a login form containing two input fields with corresponding labels, alongside a submit and a reset button. If you submit the form, the action of the form gets triggered, and you can work with the `formData`.

The layout looks nice as well (let’s imagine we have added some fancy CSS).

```html
<form action="/login" method="get">
  <div>
    <label for="username">Username</label>
    <input type="text" name="username" id="username" required />
  </div>
  
  <div>
    <label for="password">Password</label>
    <input type="password" name="password" id="password" required />
  </div>
  
  <div>
    <button type="reset">Reset</button>
    <button type="submit">Submit</button>
  </div>
</form>
```

## The Challenge
Now, let's delve into a new requirement presented by our client. They want a revamped layout with the buttons placed elsewhere. This redesign, however, leads to a problem.
The buttons are no longer within the form element which causes the buttons to lose their association to the form.

```html
<main>
  <form action="/login" method="get">
    <div>
      <label for="username">Username</label>
      <input type="text" name="username" id="username" required />
    </div>
    
    <div>
      <label for="password">Password</label>
      <input type="password" name="password" id="password" required />
    </div>
  </form>
  
  <!-- Because of the new layout, we have to move the buttons 
  outside of the form -->
  <div>
      <button type="reset">Reset</button>
      <button type="submit">Submit</button>
  </div>
</main>
```

If you try to submit or reset the form, nothing will happen.

These buttons must be within the form element to be functionally associated with it.
Unfortunately, the client insists on the new layout and to move the buttons outside the form element is the only option we have.

## The Solution
If you read the button element’s specification, there is an interesting attribute called `form`. This is very helpful in our situation and will solve our problem. We can add the `form` attribute to each button and assign a name to it. The name can be whatever you want. In our case we call it _form-login_.

<!-- Manuel: 
1. "element’s specification" <-- link please 
2. Just a general stylistic comment: The first two sentece are fillers, they don't add any value. They can be reduced to "The form attribute can help with that. We can add it..."
3. "We can add the" <- You mix forms of address. Please choose one form, adress the reader either with "you" or "we". -->

```html
<main>
  <form action="/login" method="get">
    <div>
      <label for="username">Username</label>
      <input type="text" name="username" id="username" required />
    </div>
    
    <div>
      <label for="password">Password</label>
      <input type="password" name="password" id="password" required />
    </div>
  </form>
  
  <!-- Because of the new layout, we have to move the Buttons outside of the form -->
  <div>
      <button type="reset" form="form-login">Reset</button>
      <button type="submit" form="form-login">Submit</button>
  </div>
</main>
```

Unfortunately, this step alone is not enough. To restore the functionality of the form, we have to add an `id` attribute to our form element and assign it the identical value we assigned to our buttons.

```html
<main>
  <form action="/login" method="get" id="form-login">
    <div>
      <label for="username">Username</label>
      <input type="text" name="username" id="username" required />
    </div>
    
    <div>
      <label for="password">Password</label>
      <input type="password" name="password" id="password" required />
    </div>
  </form>
  
  <!-- Because of the new layout, we have to move the Buttons outside the form -->
  <div>
      <button type="reset" form="form-login">Reset</button>
      <button type="submit" form="form-login">Submit</button>
  </div>
</main>
```

With these adjustments, our form works like before but with the freedom of positioning our buttons as we want.

<!-- Manuel: "Unfortunately, this step alone is not enough." <- that makes it sound like you have to do a lot of extra work, but it's just an id you have to add. 
Please combine the instructions for adding the attributes and the id one step and remove the second code sample. -->

## A Word on Practicality
The same approach can be applied to the `input` elements as well. Use the `form` attribute and assign them to the `input` elements and give them the value of the form elements `id`. With that approach you are free to spread the form children's even more.

<!-- Manuel: 
1. what about textarea, select, etc.? It probably works with all form elements, right? please rewrite it.
2. "With that approach you are free to spread the **form** children's even more" <- what does that mean?-->

## Accessibility concerns
With this approach you will get a lot of freedom with your layout, however, it is important to not mess up the layout too much and place the elements in an order that still makes sense to the user. Otherwise it can be confusing and frustrating.

<!-- Manuel: You're addressing a11y issues, but the potential negative impact on the user doesn't really come out. Can you elaborate a bit more on that? -->

## Browser compatibility
The `form` attribute is well supported, with Internet Explorer being an exception. Because Microsoft discontinued the support for Internet Explorer, the `form` attribute can be used without thought.
For detailed browser compatibility information, refer to [caniuse](https://caniuse.com/form-attribute).

<!-- Manuel: Please consider removing the sentence "Because Microsoft…". I have clients that still have to support IE < 10. -->

## Conclusion
With the `form` attribute we are no longer restricted to position our inputs and buttons inside the **form** element boundaries. This approach enriches the potential for more flexibility and creative form designs.
