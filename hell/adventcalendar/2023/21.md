# Introduction
Consider a scenario where you have a **login form** containing two input fields with corresponding labels, alongside a
**submit** and a **reset button**. If you submit the **form** the action of the form gets triggered, and you can work with the
**formData**.
The layout looks nice as well (let’s imagine we have added some fancy CSS).

```html
<form action="/login" method="get">
  <div>
    <label for="username">Username</label>
    <input type="text" name="username" id="username" required />
  </div>
  
  <div>
    <label for="password">Password</label>
    <input type="password" name="password" id="password" required />
  </div>
  
  <div>
    <button type="reset">Reset</button>
    <button type="submit">Submit</button>
  </div>
</form>
```

# The Challenge
Now, let's delve into a new requirement presented by our client. They want a revamped layout with the buttons placed elsewhere. This redesign, however, leads to a problem.
The buttons are no longer within the **form** element. This causes the buttons to lose their link to the **form**.

```html
<main>
  <form action="/login" method="get">
    <div>
      <label for="username">Username</label>
      <input type="text" name="username" id="username" required />
    </div>
    
    <div>
      <label for="password">Password</label>
      <input type="password" name="password" id="password" required />
    </div>
  </form>
  
  <!-- Because of the new layout, we have to move the Buttons outside of the form -->
  <div>
      <button type="reset">Reset</button>
      <button type="submit">Submit</button>
  </div>
</main>
```

If you try to submit or reset the **form**, nothing will happen.

These buttons must be within the **form** element to be functionally associated with it.
Unfortunately, the client insists on the new layout and to move the buttons outside the **form** element is the only option we have.

# The Solution
If you read the **button** element’s specification, there is an interesting attribute called **form**. This is very helpful in our situation and will solve our problem. We can add the attribute **form** to each button and assign a name to it. The name can be whatever you want. In our case we call it **form-login**.

```html
<main>
  <form action="/login" method="get">
    <div>
      <label for="username">Username</label>
      <input type="text" name="username" id="username" required />
    </div>
    
    <div>
      <label for="password">Password</label>
      <input type="password" name="password" id="password" required />
    </div>
  </form>
  
  <!-- Because of the new layout, we have to move the Buttons outside of the form -->
  <div>
      <button type="reset" form="form-login">Reset</button>
      <button type="submit" form="form-login">Submit</button>
  </div>
</main>
```

Unfortunately, this step alone is not enough. To restore the functionality of the form, we have to add an **id** attribute to our **form** element and assign it the identical value we assigned to our buttons.

```html
<main>
  <form action="/login" method="get" id="form-login">
    <div>
      <label for="username">Username</label>
      <input type="text" name="username" id="username" required />
    </div>
    
    <div>
      <label for="password">Password</label>
      <input type="password" name="password" id="password" required />
    </div>
  </form>
  
  <!-- Because of the new layout, we have to move the Buttons outside the form -->
  <div>
      <button type="reset" form="form-login">Reset</button>
      <button type="submit" form="form-login">Submit</button>
  </div>
</main>
```

With these adjustments, our form works like before but with the freedom of positioning our buttons as we want.

# A Word on Practicality
The same approach can be applied to the **input** elements as well. Use the **form** attribute and assign them to the **input** elements and give them the value of the **form** elements **id**. With that approach you are free to spread the **form** children's even more.

# Accessibility concerns
With this approach you will get a lot of freedom with your layout, however, it is important to not mess up the layout too much and place the elements in an order that still makes sense to the user. Otherwise it can be confusing and frustrating.

# Browser compatibility
The **form** attribute has a large browser support, except Internet Explorer. Because Microsoft discontinued the support for Internet Explorer, the **form** attribute can be used without thought.

# Conclusion
With the **form** attribute we are no longer restricted to position our **inputs** and **buttons** inside the **form** element boundaries. This approach enriches the potential for more flexibility and creative form designs.
