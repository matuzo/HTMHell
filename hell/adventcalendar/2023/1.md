intro: "<p>In our attempt at making interfaces easy to use, we have turned to click fixation. But no element has clicking as its functionality, and no aspect communicates clickability. An interface's means of interaction and functionality are implied through the elements, meaning that we must build from the HTML elements with help from implied and relative ARIA roles.</p>"

If we made bikes, the pedals would be the most prominent feature. We would log pedalling to make pedalling-increasing pedals and claim that bikers don’t mind pedalling as long as it has meaning. We would talk about the importance of being biker-centric while also having inspirational galleries with the shiniest, newest call-to-pedal pedals – with breaks to match. And, of course, discuss if pedal-people should know how chains work.

I’m a huge fan of humans being able to understand the world by deriving meaning from recognising objects, affordance indicators and circumstances; most of our understanding and communication happen through implication. I’m also a fan of humans being *allowed* to understand. Most things aren’t labelled and described; at most, a door tells us what’s inside, not that it is a door or that we must open it to *see more*.

Why do we struggle with implication when it comes to interfaces? Is it possible to be user-centred without pushing interaction triggers? And how can we better communicate how the interface works?

## Explicit click fixation mashup
It’s easy to think the interface is about clicks, but no element has clicking as a functionality. And there is no aspect of any element that communicates clickability. Like pedalling, clicking is just a means, and neither a task nor a goal. The click doesn’t fill forms, take people through flows or provide sudden insight.

Still, we attempt to express clickability and turn it into a feature by mixing various elements’ properties based on what we individually associate with clicking. Then, we create incoherence through coherency by applying it to all elements that fall under our understanding of being *clickable*.

### Let people think
The mantra about not making people think is not about reducing interfaces to a degree where all they have to do is mindless one-clicks. It’s about enabling people to understand the interface and related processes. By allowing them to read and think, they will also accumulate knowledge about how the web platform works, which makes other interfaces easier to use.

Trying to lower cognitive effort by pushing actions will backfire. Consider the link, the button and the select; their functionality, code and visuals are fundamentally different. When we make them as uniform as possible, hoping to increase clickability, we also lower usability, remove element meaning and replace people’s means of recognition and control.

In our quest against unnecessary cognitive effort, we must still allow people to think and gain experience to get the most out of the platform. We do that by communicating what things are.

## Element before code
We start by using the elements’ inherent aspects, both what differentiates them and what makes them related. That means working with *correct* elements, which is slightly different from working with *valid* code.

With valid code alone, we still leave room for making interfaces as clickable visuals. We can define elements by interaction triggers and do whatever we want because we compensate to meet accessibility criteria. High enough contrast and code that works with screen readers can be mistaken for good accessibility and usability. The reality of making visuals that don’t communicate element type is that no element code in the web platform can be the correct one; it doesn’t exist.

With correct elements, we don’t have to compensate to get people through the interface or to make accessible solutions. We can work with all facets simultaneously, from semantic visuals to code in order to communicate functionality and roles. Then, we also get an idea about when and how it’s OK to make more custom solutions.

### Meaning of HTML
An element can communicate its role in four ways: implied, indirect relative implied, generic and explicit. The first three come from just using the element, and the fourth is set with a role attribute. While we will concentrate on code for the rest of this article, we could place visual properties into the same categories, ideally never having to separate it from code.

The implied role is what elements have out of the box. They can also change indirectly depending on non-ARIA attributes and ancestor element types. Encoding intention through HTML happens via HTML Accessibility API Mappings (HTML-AAM). 

Elements that have no implied role are generic. That doesn’t mean the elements can be used anywhere; all HTML has designated usage areas and often visual semantics. But some don’t need a role or cannot have one because the usage wouldn’t work well with screen readers. For instance, `div`, `span` and `i` have the same generic role but different use cases and visual properties.

When it comes to explicitly set roles, we cannot set the generic role, but we can set the role to *presentation* or *none*. The two are, in contrast to generic, not exposed in accessibility APIs or accessibility trees. Assistive tech cannot gather properties, such as layout, from presentation elements.  

We use the role attribute to communicate meaning HTML doesn’t have by default. It can be because the element is versatile, and it would be impractical to have a default role, or because we need to change an element’s default role to something else. Still, we cannot transform one element into another. The role and ARIA attributes intend to change the meaning of HTML but avoid doing so when semantics are strong or equal to the ARIA semantics it already implies.

### Examples of imperative and indirect ARIA roles

1. `header` and `footer` have the generic role. When we place them inside `article`, `aside`, `main`, `nav` or `section`, or elements that have set the role to article, complementary, main, navigation or region, `header` changes role to banner and `footer` gets the role of contentinfo.
```html
<!-- header and footer with the generic role -->
<body>
	<header></header>
	<main></main>
	<footer></footer>
</body>
<!-- header and footer with banner and contentinfo roles -->
<article>
	<header></header>
	<footer></footer>
</article>
```

2. `section` has a generic role. When we give it an accessible name, typically using the aria-label attribute, it gets the role of region.
```html
<!-- section with the generic role -->
<section></section>
<!-- section with the region role -->
<section aria-label="changelog"></section>
```

3. `img` with an empty alt attribute has the role of presentation. `img` with text inside the alt attribute has the role of img. `img` without the alt attribute has the role of img.
```html
<!-- img with the presentation role -->
<img alt="" src="/" />
<!-- img with the img role -->
<img alt="horse with beard" src="/" />
<img src="/" /> <!-- don’t do this -->
```

4. `select` has the role of combobox, but if we give it the multiple attribute or a size attribute greater than one, the role changes to listbox
```html
<!-- select with the combobox role -->
<select></select>
<!-- select with the listbox role -->
<select multiple></select>
<select size="3"></select>
<select multiple size="2"></select>
```

5. `strong` and `em` have the roles of strong and emphasis. Strong is for important, serious or urgent, while emphasis is for just that. Both are misused to a level where their code semantics are no longer useful; they are practically just a way to achieve bold and italic. Assistive tech ignores the code semantics, but some can read the styling if users activate those settings. Markdown and WYSIWYG editors also fail to differentiate here and output only `strong` and `em` by default, further contributing to the misuse.
```html
<!-- The author implies that something other than the movie is a better Elvis resource. -->
<i>Elvis</i> is the best <em>movie</em> about Elvis.
<!-- The author implies that other Elvis movies have other qualities. -->
<i>Elvis</i> is the <em>best</em> movie about Elvis.
```

6. `small`, `u`, `i`, `b`, `q`, `pre` are some of the elements with generic role, just like `span`. We should still use them as intended and not interchangeably, as they have different default styling and sometimes behaviours.

7. `menu` has the role of list. It does not have the role of menu. It’s identical to `ul`; there is no inherent reason to use `menu` except if we want to separate the two in code. If we are concerned about indicating navigation, chances are we already have a `nav` element and aria-label. The possible confusion between HTML’s `menu` element and WAI-ARIA’s menu role is reason enough not to use the element. The menu role is less about navigation and more about choices and actions.

8. Many specific input types, such as color, date, file and password have no implicit ARIA role. Considering that inputs should have labels and often have attributes indicating the type, do they need a role as well?

9. `label` has no role and cannot be given an aria-label attribute.

10. Setting aria-label or aria-labelledby is prohibited on several elements such as `a` without the href attribute, `div`, `p`, `abbr`, `address`, `body`, `caption` and `code`. Elements that cannot have aria-label or aria-labelledby can be given those if they change role, granted that they can change role.
```html
<!-- not allowed -->
<div aria-label="news"></div>
<a aria-label="crows">Crows</a>
<!-- allowed -->
<div role="article" aria-label="news"></div>
<a href="crows.png" aria-label="crows">Crow picture</a>
```

11. `thead`, `tbody` and `tfoot` have the role of rowgroup though they are different elements and siblings. It reminds us that each one can have multiple rows.

12. `dialog` has the role of dialog. It also has an implied aria-modal attribute set to true if it has been opened with the `showModal()` method. If we use `show()` method or the open attribute, aria-modal will be false, but the dialog role remains.

## Programming communication
ARIA roles have a huge caveat: Most assistive technology support neither roles nor certain elements’ implicit ARIA.

What is the point then?

First, we must hope better ARIA semantics support is coming. But also, when the goal is to create meaning, it’s best to work with elements that already have meaning. If we instead work with code, visuals, function and behaviour separately, we end up with mutated and rehashed elements. We remove and override semantics in favour of arbitrariness like branding and other expressions of misguided visual consistency that lower usability. And we find ourselves compensating by screaming at people to click.

Every HTML element is a compound of semantic properties contributing to helping people understand. Most meaning comes for free with the native web elements, leading to fewer lines of code. A minuscule increase in workload comes from concentrating on which elements to use.

Programming is communication work. Communication requires intent and meaning. Use the web platform to tell browsers how it should work for people. Tell people explicitly when browsers and other means of interaction fall short. Avoid scrambling for accessibility. That’s the implied web.
