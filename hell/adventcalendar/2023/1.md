intro: "<p>Customisable template for accessibility guidelines. Not too granular but not too superficial either. Should help to provide a framework to get started with accessibility.</p>"
---

## Foreword

This template is opinionated and intended as a starting point for those who want to define how accessibility is dealt with in their company. It does not matter whether your title is developer, designer, project manager or something else.

I created it based on my experience working with a very small start-up, a digital agency with more than 250 employees and a monolithic company with very fixed structures.

When creating this template, I had the [six most common WCAG failures](https://webaim.org/projects/million/#wcag) in mind, but also what processes take place when you collaborate with other people. Nothing is set in stone and it should be adapted in consultation with your colleagues, because accessibility is a group effort! More on that in [Prependix](#1-prependix).

As a reference, I refer to the [Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.2](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/), as they are popular and well documented. However, you are free to include a different one or more in this template, depending on your location and the requirements that need to be met.

With all that being said, let's have a look at the template! üëÄ

## 1. Prependix

To ensure that our products are usable and accessible, we comply with **level AA success criteria** of the [Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.2](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/). For a better understanding of these guidelines, check out the following resources:

<!-- Saptak: Should the template link to WCAG 2.2 given that's the current recommendation? The issue with that might be that a lot of links referenced below are still using WCAG 2.1 standards. -->
<!-- Steve: I'd like to keep this overview, as it's less intimidating than the actual guidelines. It also says that: "The guidelines are the same in WCAG 2.1 and WCAG 2.2." So I think this should be safe to use? -->

- [WCAG, but in language I can understand](https://www.tempertemper.net/blog/wcag-but-in-language-i-can-understand) by tempertemper
- [WCAG 2.2 Map](https://intopia.digital/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Intopia-WCAG-2.2-Map-Portrait-Mode.pdf) by Intopia
- [Accessibility Not-Checklist](https://not-checklist.intopia.digital/) by Intopia

<!-- Manuel: Where's the AAA coming from? The title of the post is "WCAG, but in language I can understand" -->
<!-- Saptak: +1 to what Manuel said. It seems to cover all success criteria irrespective of the level. -->
<!-- Steve: I have no idea why this was there. üòÖ Changed it, as well as the link for the WCAG Map. -->

**Accessibility is a group effort and not a one-person show.** It goes beyond leaving it to designers or developers. Being aware and curious about it will not only help you, but also the people around you.

<!-- Eric: Love the framing here, and wonder if we can touch on this thought earlier in the intro as well. That way you can also communicate that the template is for more than just your own work. -->
<!-- Steve: Added a short note that I will elaborate it in this section. -->

**It is not possible to create a product that is 100% accessible.** However, this is no reason to give up or to not start at all. ‚ÄúProgress over perfection‚Äù is our approach, because every little improvement counts and will make someone‚Äôs life easier.

**You're never done with accessibility.** Wether you're just starting your journey, or maintaining a current project: People (and their needs) are constantly changing, as well as technology, so you'll need to pay attention and adapt accordingly. If you want to get a better understanding of this particular topic, check out [Microsoft Inclusive Design](https://inclusive.microsoft.design/).

## 2. Design

Whenever possible, we want to not only meet the minimum for level AA success criteria, but also go beyond that. It is therefore possible that there is no direct WCAG recommendation for some of our requirements.

<!-- Manuel: Observation: You have an underlined sentence in all chapters but the first. -->
<!-- Manue: "greatest potential to avoid adaptations regarding accessibility afterwards" <- I'd say that the greatest potential to avoid them happens at least one step earlier. -->
<!-- Steve: Agreed and I will ditch this sentence entirely, because I'll make a disclaimer that some of these custom requirments might not have a corresponding WCAG failure. -->

<!-- Manuel: In the list below, wouldn't it make more sense to start with the text first followed by the image instead of the other way around? -->
<!-- Steve: Will do! -->
<!-- Manuel: For each examole, please link to the criteria in WCAG it fails. -->
<!-- Steve: See my comment above. -->

### 2.1 Color contrast

<a href="/images/advent2023/accessibility-template/htmlhell-color-contrast-example.png">
  <img alt="Illustration showcasing the difference of color contrast for an item on the Kaufland website. There are two images, both showing the contrast ratio. The first one has insufficient color contrast, showing values of 3.31:1 and 3.01:1. The second one is were requirements are met, with ratios of 4.6:1 and 4.65:1." src="/images/advent2023/accessibility-template/htmlhell-color-contrast-example.png">
</a>

<!-- Manuel: Not the best example: generic link text and link with no underline. üò¨ -->

**Color contrast** must be level AA, if possible level AAA compliant. If text is in front of an image, provide a layer in between.

*Related WCAG recommendation: [Success Criterion 1.4.3 Contrast (Minimum)](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/#contrast-minimum)*

### 2.2 Font size

<a href="/images/advent2023/accessibility-template/htmlhell-font-size-example.png">
  <img alt="Illustration showcasing the difference of font sizes on the german Samsung website. Both images showing the font sizes. The first one's font size is too small, with only 12 pixel. The second one is meeting the requirement with 14 pixel." src="/images/advent2023/accessibility-template/htmlhell-font-size-example.png">
</a>

**Font size** is at least 14 pixels, preferably 16 pixels.

*No related WCAG recommendation, this is based on real life experience.*

<!-- Manuel: In the JYSK example it says "not compliant". According to which guidelines? WCAG or this template? Afaik, there isn't a minimum font size requirement in WCAG. I could be wrong, though. -->
<!-- Saptak: I think WCAG only mentions that it should be allowed to zoom to at least 200% and there is criteria related to text spacing. I am not aware of any font size mention. -->
<!-- Eric: Yep, just dealt with this at work. No minimum font size, just zoom support. -->

### 2.3 Touch target size

<a href="/images/advent2023/accessibility-template/htmlhell-touch-target-size-example.png">
  <img alt="Illustration showcasing the difference of touch target sizes on the german Bosch website. Both images show a section of the footer, with three social media icons having a 2 pixel solid red broder around the, to visualise the target size. The first one's target size is too small with only 24 by 24 pixel (yet meeting the WCAG requirement). The second one's sufficient with 44 by 44 pixel." src="/images/advent2023/accessibility-template/htmlhell-touch-target-size-example.png">
</a>

**Touch target size** should be at least 44 x 44 pixels, preferably more.

*Related WCAG recommendation: [Success Criterion 2.5.5 Target Size (Enhanced)](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/#target-size-enhanced)*

### 2.4 Conveying meaning

<a href="/images/advent2023/accessibility-template/htmlhell-conveying-meaning-example.png">
  <img alt="Illustration showcasing the difference of meaningfull labels on the german Mango website. Both images show a section of the main navigation. The first one's only showing four icons but without a label. The second one's having labels associated to the icons: Search, log in, wishlist and cart." src="/images/advent2023/accessibility-template/htmlhell-conveying-meaning-example.png">
</a>

**Convey meaning** not only through colors or icons. If possible, add a descriptive label to the element in question.

*Related WCAG recommendation: [Success Criterion 1.4.1 Use of Color](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/#use-of-color)*

### 2.5 Focus behaviour

<a href="/images/advent2023/accessibility-template/htmlhell-focus-behaviour-example.png">
  <img alt="Illustration showcasing focus behaviour on the Rituals website. All the images show a section with a headline, some text and a 'Shop Now' button. The first image shows the button with no focus. The second image shows the focussed button, but it's dark blue focus is barely visible, as it's directly attached to the black button. The third image shows a black focus ring with 2 pixel distance on every side, making it much more visible." src="/images/advent2023/accessibility-template/htmlhell-focus-behaviour-example.png">
</a>

All interactive elements have a **clearly visible focus state**. It might be a change of background and font color, or a focus ring. If the latter, it should have a width and offset of at least 2 pixels.

*Related WCAG recommendations:*

- [Success Criterion 2.4.7 Focus Visible](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/#focus-visible)
- [Success Criterion 1.4.11 Non-text Contrast](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/#non-text-contrast)
- [Success Criterion 2.4.11 Focus Not Obscured (Minimum)](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/#focus-not-obscured-minimum)

### 2.6 Media controls

When creating components such as carousels (sometimes called sliders) or any sort of media player, make sure it has controls to:

- Navigate to the next or previous item
- Stop and start the media
- Show or hide captions (if applicable)

*Related WCAG recommendation:*

- [Success Criterion 1.2.2 Captions (Prerecorded)](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/#captions-prerecorded)
- [Success Criterion 2.2.2 Pause, Stop, Hide](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/#pause-stop-hide)

### 2.7 User flow

When visualising how users interact with a certain feature or component, keep in mind they will not only use a mouse. They might also use a keyboard, screen readers or other assistive technologies. So ask yourself: Can this (thing I'm working on) be used by anyone at any time? Is there something that might exclude certain people?

*Related WCAG recommendation: [Operable](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/#operable)*

<!-- Manuel: can you explain "User flow" or link to a ressource that explains what it is? -->
<!-- Steve: Got rid of the word and used a more general explanation. -->

<!-- Eric: How specifically do you take a keyboard-only or screen reader users into consideration? -->
<!-- Steve: Instead of going into specifics, I changed the wording. Let me know what you think!  -->

### 2.8 Landmarks & annotations

Provide a version of your design with **landmarks and accessibility annotations**. This will help communicating with developers and improve accessibility across all browsers. You can find plenty of resources regarding this topic (and much more) in Stephanie Walter's [Designer‚Äôs Guide to Documenting Accessibility & User Interactions](https://stephaniewalter.design/blog/a-designers-guide-to-documenting-accessibility-user-interactions/).

### 2.9 Handover

A design is only ready for development, if it has been **approved by at least one other member of your team** (Note by the author: This could be a developer, another designer, quality assurance, accessibility expert, or whoever else might be responsible). Before moving on, all open issues must be resolved.

(Note by the author: All things mentioned are supposed to help you avoid the most common accessibility mistakes but this list isn't extensive and there's much more to consider. Again, this template is supposed be a starting point. Feel free to extend it however you want!)

<!-- Manuel: Most of those things are also WCAG criteria, but you don't mention all design related recommendations in WCAG. I don't know how you picked those exactly, but I think you should mention that this list isn't extensive and that there's more you need to consider. -->
<!-- Steve: Added a note that will hopefully suffice? -->

<!-- Saptak: I am not so sure about "approved by at least one developer". Maybe more like "approved by at least one accessibility expert" or something similar. I think it gives the wrong notion that only a developer knows accessibility issues and not a designer. In my experience, there are many designers with far more accessibility expertise than many developers. -->
<!-- Steve: Changed the wording! -->

<!-- Eric: +1 to Saptak's comment. Each organization has a different release process (or none at all), and genericize the language here might help a reader out. Instead, we might want to speak to the desired outcome and not the process: we want a developer to review it as a signifier that they understand what is to be expected of them and their team. -->

<!-- Saptak: "The design review happens directly in Figma by adding comments" I think this is a good opportunity to maybe talk about accessibility annotations? And link to something like https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eDCd-isluUY -->
<!-- Steve: I added the written version of it. ü§ó -->

## 3. Development
<!-- Manuel: The tips you give here are fine but they also seem super random. Why and how did you come up with those suggestions specifically? -->
<!-- Steve: From my experience, these are issues developers are either not aware of, or get VERY wrong, especially heading levels. They can be extended to one's liking, though, as this template should be considered a starting point. -->

Putting the following rules into practice will ensure a robust, easy-to-use UI which will not only improve accessibility, but in certain cases might also be benfecial for SEO.

<!-- Eric: I might suggest not leading with SEO. Doing accessibility for accessibility's sake should be enough. Leading with something that defocuses that artificially chips away at its credibility. -->
<!-- Steve: You're right, I changed the wording. However, I think it's worth mentioning it as there are interesections between the two topics. Let me know if you want me to (briefly) elobarote on them. -->

### 3.1 Semantic HTML

Use **semantic HTML** wherever possible to leverage native browser behavior. If progressive enhancement is needed, apply it with CSS and / or JavaScript. 

*Related MDN documentation:* [Progressive enhancement](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Progressive_Enhancement)

### 3.2 Skip link

Add a **skip link** so keyboard users can jump straight to the main content. This also requires a `<main>` element present in the DOM. Related links:

- [Creating "Skip Navigation" Links](https://webaim.org/techniques/skipnav/#creating)
- [Documentation `<main>` element](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/main)

### 3.3 Heading levels

**Heading levels** should be used appropriately and not be skipped. Also do not use heading elements simply for the sake of styling! If a heading needs to look a certain way, apply a CSS class instead.

*Related MDN documentation:* [The HTML Section Heading elements](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/Heading_Elements)
*Related WCAG recommendation: [Success Criterion 2.4.10 Section Headings](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/#section-headings)*

<!-- Manuel: I think I know what you're trying to say, but it's not clear enough that you're recommending to avoid using certain heading levels only for they sake of their visuals. -->
<!-- Steve: Added a sentence, hope this makes it clearer? -->

### 3.4 Typography

For **typography**, use a relative unit like `rem` instead of `px`. This will give users the ability to adjust the font size to their needs. Also install fonts locally instead of fetching them from an external source to improve performance.

*Related article:* [The Surprising Truth About Pixels and Accessibility](https://www.joshwcomeau.com/css/surprising-truth-about-pixels-and-accessibility/#accessibility-considerations-5)

### 3.5 Buttons & anchors

Make sure you use the right element when deciding between **a button and a link** (actually called **anchor**). A button does something, an anchor element changes the URL in the browser. There are exceptions though, for example an anchor with the `email` or `tel` attribute. Both elements should have an accessible name for optimal screen reader support and search engine optimisation.

<!-- Manuel: A link also does something, not just a button. Also, not all links change the url (email, tel) -->
<!-- Steve: Added additional info -->

*Related MDN documentation:*

- [Documentation `button` element](https://developer.mozilla.org/de/docs/Web/HTML/Element/button)
- [Documentation `a` element](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/a)

*Related article:*

- [Button versus links](https://css-tricks.com/buttons-vs-links/)

### 3.6 Alternative text

Images must have **descriptive alternative text**. If they are purely decorative, use `alt=""`. Otherwise provide [a sufficient image description](https://design102.blog.gov.uk/2022/01/14/whats-the-alternative-how-to-write-good-alt-text/). If you must provide an icon-only interaction, make sure it has an accessible name by using `aria-label`.

*Related WCAG recommendation: [Success Criterion 1.1.1 Non-text Content](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/#non-text-content)*

<!-- Eric: An icon-only interaction control with a concise, descriptive accessible name is technically compliant, if not necessarily ideal for situations like voice control or lower tech literacy. Can we clarify that part some? -->
<!-- Steve: Changed it, hope this works for you? -->

### 3.7 Operability

Interactive elements can be **operated by mouse, keyboard, screen reader and other assistive technology**. If such an element must consist only of an icon or color (which it should not), provide an accessible name with `aria-label`.

<!-- Saptak: Why only "mouse, keyboard and a screen reader"? There are many other assistive technologies as well. Maybe rephrase the sentence to say "mouse, keyboard, screen reader and other assistive technologies". -->
<!-- Steve: Changed it! -->

### 3.8 Preference detection

Some people have a **preference for how content should be displayed** on their devices. For example, they may have a dark theme activated on their operating system, or a high contrast mode. It is also possible that they prefer motion or transparency to be reduced. To respect all these scenarios, the following media queries can be applied:

- [prefers-color-scheme](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/@media/prefers-color-scheme)
- [prefers-contrast](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/@media/prefers-contrast)
- [prefers-reduced-motion](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/@media/prefers-reduced-motion)
- [prefers-reduced-transparency](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/@media/prefers-reduced-transparency)

## 4. Testing

Whether you work in design, development or quality assurance: Testing is an essential part of the job and happens during the process and before you ship anything.

### 4.1 Browsers

**Use different browsers to test** what you are working on. Google **Chrome** (Chromium engine) and Mozilla **Firefox** (Gecko engine) can be used on any operating system, except Apple iOS. When using MacOS, use Apple **Safari** (WebKit engine) as well.

<!-- Manuel: blink engine? -->
<!-- Steve: I'm not sure what you mean. Doing some research I'm also not sure if Chrome is still using Chromium, or Blink, or both? üòÖ -->
<!-- Manuel: "can be used on any operating system" <- not on iOS -->
<!-- Steve: Changed it! -->

### 4.2 Browser extensions

**Browser extensions** are a free and quick way to run accessibility scans. Most of them are based on the axe-core library and a mix of the following will cover enough ground. However, there are many more extensions out there worth exploring and testing.

- [axe DevTools](https://www.deque.com/axe/devtools/)
- [Stark](https://www.getstark.co/) (To generate reports)
- [WAVE](https://wave.webaim.org/)

### 4.3 Screen reader

A **screen reader** will help you to understand the structure of a page or element. It will also show you a different way of user interaction. On **Windows** you can use [JAWS](https://www.freedomscientific.com/products/software/jaws/) (paid) or [NVDA](https://www.nvaccess.org/download/) (free). [VoiceOver](https://www.apple.com/accessibility/vision/) is available on all *Apple* devices for free. For **Android** you can use [Talkback](https://support.google.com/accessibility/android/answer/6283677?hl=en). Related link: [Guides to browsing and navigating content with a screen reader by Sara Soueidan](https://www.sarasoueidan.com/blog/testing-environment-setup/#guides-to-browsing-and-navigating-content-with-a-screen-reader)

### 4.4 Pipeline integration

Integrating accessibility checks into the **deployment pipeline** is another great way to ensure requirements are met. For example a push or merge will not be possible if there are linting errors or a failed unit test. Related links:

- [Automating the accessibility tests of your source code with GitHub Actions](https://www.adrianbolonio.com/blog/accessibility-github-actions)
- [Stark for GitHub](https://www.getstark.co/blog/introducing-stark-for-developers-beta)

### 4.5 Other apps & tools

To check **WCAG conformance** of color contrast, use the app [Colour Contrast Analyser by TPGi](https://www.tpgi.com/color-contrast-checker/). You can also check the color contrast in the browser using [WebAim Contrast Checker](https://webaim.org/resources/contrastchecker/).

When using **Figma**, there are a couple of great plugins to check for accessibility. **Stark** has a great UI and the free version offers **contrast check, adding landmarks and vision simulator**. Another noteworthy plugin is [A11y - Focus Order](https://www.figma.com/community/plugin/731310036968334777/A11y---Focus-Order).
