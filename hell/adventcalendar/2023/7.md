<!-- Eric: Thanks for writing this! One big-picture suggestion I have is to link to the MDN or the spec for each attribute you cite. It'll help assert authority, as well as proactively help folk self-serve if they're curious. -->

You say you know HTML. But did you realise it includes over 100 elements and even more attributes? How many can you name? And do you know how important some of them are in terms of accessibility?
<!-- Manuel: Our readers probably know that HTML is extensive. How is their ability to name elements or attributes important for this post? I've read this kind of intro in many posts about HTML and I think we can skip it here. If you're ok with it, please delete this sentence. -->

This blog post will introduce you to some HTML attributes you may have never heard of (or simply forgotten), and it will teach you how to use them.
<!-- Manuel: Why assume that people don't know them or have forgotten about them? Do you have data (like from the http archive almanac) to back that assumption up? I think it would be better if you make this less about the reader and more about you, like “here are 5 of my favourite attributes you can use to…” or “here are 5 attributes I've learned about recently", etc. -->

## 1. hreflang

The `hreflang` attribute **specifies the language of a linked resource** on an `<a>` or `<link>` element. It works like the `lang` attribute but is specifically used for links.

### Why use `hreflang`?

You can improve the user experience and SEO by using `hreflang` for both internal and external site links. It also helps people who use assistive technology by informing them of the expected language when they click.
Using `hreflang` on internal website links provides a way to tell search engines about different variations of a page for other languages or regions. This means that English speakers would receive the English version of the site, while Swedish speakers would receive the Swedish version. There is no need for manual switching on the user's end, resulting in a smoother experience.
<!-- Manuel: "It also helps people who use assistive technology" -> I didn't know that. Have you tested this yourself? Or do you have a resource you could reference? An example of what a screenreader might announce would be cool! 
" This means that English speakers would receive the English version" -> Do you happen to have an example where we could see this in action?
-->
<!-- Eric: +1 to Manuel's comments. I don't believe `hreflang` has any AT support, but I could be wrong! -->

<!-- 
  Eric:
  >resulting in a smoother experience
  One interesting thing here is hreflang is invisible, in that a user isn't aware of it unless the link has a name that indicates its purpose. From an inclusion standpoint, we want to be very careful about making assumptions about a user's location versus their language preference. 
-->



### How is `hreflang` used?
<!-- Manuel: Please use active instead of passive phrasing, e.g. “how to use hreflang”. -->

Add the `hreflang` attribute with the needed [ISO language code](https://www.iso.org/iso-639-language-codes.html) to your `<a>` element. For an English website, this would be `en`.
<!-- Manuel: Maybe link to this list instead https://www.iana.org/assignments/language-subtag-registry/language-subtag-registry -->


```html
<a href="https://example.com" hreflang="en">English Website</a>
```

You can also be more specific with the language code and use regional variations. For example, we can add `de-AT` for Austrian German.

<!-- Eric: I believe the back half of the lang code "-AT" isn't currently supported by anything I'm aware of. -->

```html
<a href="https://example.at" hreflang="de-AT">German Website</a>
```

If your website is available in multiple languages, you can use `hreflang` in your language switcher.
Add `hreflang` with the required language code to each link. One link should act as the default fallback version, identifiable by adding `hreflang="x-default"` instead of the language code. Lastly, set the value of the `rel` attribute to `"alternate"` for each link in the language switcher to indicate that the linked pages are alternatives to the present page.

```html
<a href="https://example.com" rel="alternate" hreflang="x-default">English</a>
<a href="https://example.com/de" rel="alternate" hreflang="de">German</a>
```

Sometimes, language switchers use link text in the language they are switching to. You can indicate this by additionally using the `lang` attribute.

```html
<a href="https://example.com" rel="alternate" hreflang="x-default">English</a>
<a href="https://example.com/de" rel="alternate" hreflang="de" lang="de">Deutsch</a>
```

<p class="highlight">
<strong>Note:</strong> Adding the <code>lang</code> attribute is particularly important for assistive technology users. For instance, screen readers alter their voice and pronunciation based on the language attribute.
</p>

<!-- Manuel: How would you use it with the <link> element? An example would be great! -->

<!-- Eric: Lovely callout here! One other suggestion I might have is `aria-current="true"` for the currently set language link. -->

## 2. translate

The `translate` attribute is used to **indicate whether an element should be translated** or not.

### Why use `translate`?

All website text is translatable by default. Translation tools, such as Google Translate, may suggest translation of page contents if the site's defined language differs from the browser's default language. However, there may be instances where this behaviour is unwanted.
Specific terms like company names, e-mail addresses or code examples should generally not be translated to avoid confusion. Automated translations are not always completely accurate, particularly with niche or technical words.

<!-- Manuel: "All website text is translatable by default." -> I'm not sure about this sentence. It can be confusing because not _all_ text is translatable. Delete it maybe? -->
<!-- Eric: Or maybe a slight adjustment that points out some of its gaps? Something like "Most website text is translatable by default (with X, Y, and Z being exceptions)." -->

<!-- 
  Eric:
  >code examples
  It has been a minute since I evaluated this, but I think most browser auto-translators ignore content placed in <code> and <pre>? Might want to test this before publishing to verify.
-->

### How is `translate` used?
<!-- Manuel: active instead of passive phrasing please -->

You can use translate on any HTML element. Assign an empty string (`""`) or `yes` for translation and `no` to avoid translation.

```html
<!-- Original German text -->
<p>
  <span translate="yes">Wien<span> 
  ist (wieder) die lebenswerteste Stadt der Welt!
</p>
<p>
  <span translate="no">Wien<span> 
  ist (wieder) die lebenswerteste Stadt der Welt!
</p>

<!-- What it would look like translated into English -->
<p>
  <span translate="yes">Vienna<span> 
  named world's most liveable city (again)!
</p>
<p>
  <span translate="no">Wien<span> 
  named world's most liveable city (again)!
</p>

```

<!-- Manuel: So “yes” is the default? Maybe remove it from the example because you don't need it to achieve the desired result and only leave the no-variation. -->

## 3. reversed

The `reversed` attribute is used to **reverse ordered lists** (`<ol>`) in the opposite order.

<!-- Eric: One of my favorite attributes! -->

### Why use `reversed`?

By using the `reversed` attribute, the visual order of the list items remains the same, but they are numbered from highest to lowest. This is useful if you wish to make a countdown of your top five desserts, for example.

Using the `reversed` attribute keeps the order of visual list items the same, but they are numbered from highest to lowest. This means adding this attribute to your ordered list (`<ol>`) will not reverse the list items but only the list numbers. For instance, this behaviour is helpful if you want to count down your top five desserts.

<!-- Manuel: 
1. Repetition. You said the same a bit differently in the previous paragraph.
2. Does a screen reader start with 5 as well or is it really only visual? Worth mentioning in a sentence. -->

<p class="highlight">
<strong>Note:</strong> The reversed attribute does not affect unordered lists (<code>&lt;ul&gt;</code>).
</p>

### How is `reversed` used?
<!-- Manuel: active instead of passive phrasing please -->

Add the `reversed` attribute to your list element.

```html
<ol reversed>
  <li>Cookies</li>
  <li>Crema Catalana</li>
  <li>Tiramisu</li>
  <li>Pastel de Nata</li>
  <li>Sacher cake</li>
</ol>
```

This will result in the following reversed list:

<ol reversed>
  <li>Cookies</li>
  <li>Crema Catalana</li>
  <li>Tiramisu</li>
  <li>Pastel de Nata</li>
  <li>Sacher cake</li>
</ol>

## 4. controls

The `controls` attribute instructs the browser to **show the standard video or audio controls**.

### Why use `controls`?

Including playback controls on your video and audio content is essential for optimal user experience, accessibility and usability. These controls enable users to stop or adjust video/sound playback and assist those who may experience motion sickness or distraction while browsing your website.
The default controls include the playback essentials such as play, pause, seek (moving position) and volume, as well as fullscreen toggle, [captions/subtitles and track](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/track) for video content only.
<!-- Manuel: 
1. Please consider using this link: /tips/the-track-element/
2. "captions/subtitles and track" <- *if present -->

<p class="highlight">
<strong>Note:</strong> The default controls cannot be styled with CSS.
</p>

### How is `controls` used?
<!-- Manuel: active instead of passive phrasing please -->

You can add the `controls` attribute to the `<video>` or `<audio>` element.

```html
<video controls>
  <source src="movie.mp4" type="video/mp4">
  <source src="movie.ogg" type="video/ogg">

  <track kind="captions" src="sampleCaptions.vtt" srclang="en" />
  <track kind="subtitles" src="sampleSubtitles_en.vtt" srclang="en" />
  <track kind="subtitles" src="sampleSubtitles_de.vtt" srclang="de" />

  Your browser does not support the video tag.
</video>
```

<p class="highlight">
<strong>Note:</strong> The browser controls provided as defaults are often inaccessible via keyboard, which makes them unusable for keyboard-based navigation. Consider <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Accessibility/Multimedia#creating_custom_audio_and_video_controls">implementing custom controls</a> or integrating an external media player equipped with accessibility features.
</p>

<!--
Manuel:
1. Can you please elaborate what "inaccessible" means? Is it the case in all browsers? 
2. How does this align with the general topic of the post? “**5 HTML attributes for improved accessibility”** but better not use this attribute because it's not accessible? If you want to keep the attribute in the list, you should change the title of your post and the overlaying theme. If not, it's probably better to use another attribute or frame it differently, e.g. “better than nothing but be aware of accessibility issues in browser xyz.” -->

<!-- Eric: I might suggesting moving this note higher, in that someone might race off to use this and not read to the end of the section to learn about its risks -->

## 5. autocomplete

The `autocomplete` attribute **enables the browser to complete form values automatically** and can be applied to the `<form>`, `<input>`, `<select>`, and `<textarea>` elements.

### Why use `autocomplete`?

The `autocomplete` attribute enhances the manageability and efficiency of an HTML form for end users by communicating the purpose of a specific form field to browsers and assistive technologies. Some people may not understand the meaning of a field due to unfamiliar labels, while others may want to type less to complete the form. With the `autocomplete` attribute present, a browser can suggest a previous user's input for a form field's value, resulting in significant benefits for individuals with cognitive impairments, reduced mobility, attention deficits, low vision, or blindness.

<!-- Manuel: 
1. First sentence: Pretty complex sentence. Can you explain it simpler?
2. "by communicating the purpose of a specific form field to browsers and assistive technologies" Are you sure about that? Can you give an example what SRs announce?
3. "Some people may not understand the meaning of a field due to unfamiliar labels, " how does the attribute help sighted users with bad labels?
4. “resulting in significant benefits for individuals with" how? why? checkout the "benefits" section here for inspiration: https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/identify-input-purpose.html -->

  Eric:
  >With the `autocomplete` attribute present, a browser can suggest a previous user's input for a form field's value, resulting in significant benefits for individuals with cognitive impairments, reduced mobility, attention deficits, low vision, or blindness.
  I think this sentence cuts to the heart of the matter. I'd encourage you to place it first for your revision.
-->

### How is `autocomplete` used?

You can assign different values to `autocomplete`.

If you choose `off`, the browser cannot automatically enter or select a value for this field.

```html
<label for="email">E-Mail</label>
<input name="email" id="email" type="email" autocomplete="off" />
```

<p class="highlight">
<strong>Note:</strong> Many password managers may still prompt the user to save information or use previously stored data.
</p>

If you choose `on`, the browser will complete the input automatically. However, since no further information concerning the expected data is given, the browser may use its own judgement.

```html
<form action="/" autocomplete="on">
  <label for="firstname">First Name</label>
  <input type="text" name="firstname" id="firstname" />

  <label for="lastname">Last Name</label>
  <input type="text" name="lastname" id="lastname" />

  <label for="email">Email</label>
  <input type="email" name="email" id="email" />
</form>
```

The optimal solution is to specify distinct values for the required data by opting for the corresponding value from a [list of available input purposes](<https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/#input-purposes>).

Your form could look like this:

```html
<form action="/" autocomplete="on">
  <label for="firstName">First Name</label>
  <input autocomplete="given-name" name="firstName" id="firstName" type="text" />
  
  <label for="lastName">Last Name</label>
  <input autocomplete="family-name" name="lastName" id="lastName" type="text" />
  
  <label for="email">Email</label>
  <input autocomplete="email" name="email" id="email" type="email" />
</form>
```

<p class="highlight">
<strong>Note:</strong> The absence or incorrect use of an <code>autocomplete</code> attribute in an input field can cause inconvenience to users, particularly those with cognitive disabilities. Browsers cannot suggest accurate values, making it difficult for individuals to provide the expected input. Please make sure you choose the correct value.
</p>

<!-- Eric: I wonder if it's also worth delving into propritary autocomplete attributes, such as Apple's password suggestion stuff. Not something comprehensive, but more as a jumping off point to show there's a lot of differnet items present in this space past the scope of this article. -->

## Conclusion

Hopefully this article has inspired you to enhance your understanding of HTML by highlighting some less familiar attributes. Keep in mind the importance of usability, accessibility and simplicity when starting your next project.

<!-- Manuel: If you change the intro, also please adapt the conclusion. -->
